      <h1>Quantifying Racism in Canada, 2018 - 2022</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        From 2018 - 2022, members of Canadian Cultural Mosaic Foundation are
        conducting a quantitative research project that tracks incidences of
        racisms and racialization in Canada. The project measures criminal
        cases, claims brought to Human Rights Tribunals and accusations of
        racisms and racialization that have all been reported to mainstream
        Canadian news agencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        The experiences of racisms is not the same for everyone, as such, this
        study utilizes the anti-racism term "racisms" to express differences of
        experiences among racialized or Indigenized people. While many other
        reputable organizations have measured hate crimes in Canada, this
        project expands its analysis by including non-criminal incidences of
        racisms and racialization, wherein an individual or group of people
        raises concerns about racisms against another individual, group or
        institution. It is well known that not all incidences of racisms are
        reported to the police or are brought to a Human Rights tribunal. As
        such, this study reports on accusations of racisms by individuals and
        group.
